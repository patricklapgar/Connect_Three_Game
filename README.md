# Connect_Three_Game

# Introduction
This is a beginner app that I've made with Android Studio. 
The purpose is not to showcase any special code and such, but to serve as a reference to use when I build other applications later on.

# How it works
The user launches the app and it works like a mix of Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four. 
The user taps on a square and a colored circle drops to mark the user's spot. 
The app then also places its own circle and this continues until either the user wins or the computer wins.
